# Tip_Calculator
# It is basically a tip calculator that can be used in a restaurant or a cafe to calculate a tip based on the percentage of the total bill.
# In order to build a tip calculator, we would use three different programming languages, viz â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The importance of each of the language is specified below:

# HTML:
# HTML is used to create a layout of tip calculator. HTML forms the basics of the project and specifies its parameters.

# CSS:
# The next step in the process is CSS which helps in making the calculator more presentable and attractive for better outlook.

# JavaScript:
# The last step in the process will be giving the calculator a logical implementation which would be done using JavaScript.
